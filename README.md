# Generate password plugin for Sublime Text 3

(This is a fork of [GeneratePassword](https://github.com/iambibhas/GeneratePassword))

Add generation of passwords in different strengthes to the command palette:

* Generate short password: 10 alphanumeric characters
* Generate medium password: 15 alphanumeric characters
* Generate long password: 20 alphanumeric characters
* Generate secure password: all the above lengths with special characters `!@#$%^&*_-+=|/?:;<>~`

Human readable characters are without confusable characters like "0", "O", "1", "l" and so on.

It generates a different password for each cursor/selection you have in Sublime
